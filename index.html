                Have you ever had the time that as a programmer/developer you felt so down, unmotivated and just simply out of your normal coding loop? If you didn’t had that feeling, then congratulations you must be born perfectly to program and deal with all the problems
                the world throws at you, but if you have, then welcome and feel comfy to the natural woes of being a programmer and of life.
            </p>
            <p>
                When that feeling came to me I'm lucky that before I decided to change career and deviate totally from the field of technology that’s the time that I found a channel in YouTube titled: <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jsonmez" target="_blank">Simple Programmer.</a></strong>                The guy in the video thumbnail does not look like a programmer I thought, <em>'coz his flexing his muscle</em>, but that’s the beauty of it. John Sonmez, the Software Developer/ Author/ Athlete/ Entrepreneur/ Speaker… is the guy that motivated
                me to continue, through his videos, the plan that I had for my career as a web developer. His videos ranges from programming topics and trends, body building tips, book reviews and of course motivational videos that really hits the right
                spot for me.
            </p>
            <p>
                The good thing about his motivational videos is he speaks his mind and tells you the hard truth, a thing that most of the people around us are afraid to tell. So, next time you’re out of motivation or just getting lazy doing the tasks that you are supposed
                to be doing try hitting one of his videos that caught your attention and he might just have the right dosage for your need.
            </p>
            <p>
                To the SP Guy, John, kudos to your work and let this simple tribute page mark as a thank you from one of the people that you inspired and motivated.
